# Introduction
This project set out to explore the AdventureWorks dataset from Microsoft SQL Server. The dataset contains sales data for a fictitious company. The goal was to explore the data and create a PowerBI report to answer questions about the company.

SQL queries and Power BI files are included in the repository.
